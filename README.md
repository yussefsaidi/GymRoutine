## Installation
Git clone the repository, import project in Android Studio, and run on an android device.

## Architecture Overview
This application makes use of the MVVM architectural pattern. 
Our project follows: Activity -> ViewModel -> Repository -> Remote Data Source -> Retrofit -> Webservice.
LiveData is retrieved from the Remote Data Source into our repository, then it trickles down all the way to our ViewModel. The activities do not hold data.
